# Project journal for qiskit-pi


## Wednesday 03 June 2020

Now that I have a stable, fast install of qiskit on the Pi I will attempt a docker build.

I've installed docker on `quantum` - the 8GB Pi 4.
 
Getting going:
1. ~~Create this project~~
1. ~~set it up as a private (for now) GitHub repo~~
1. ~~give `quantum` access to my a/c on GitHub~~

NB rust unistall script is at `/usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh` in the docker image
